""" Math operators include:

    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    * (multiplication)
    / (division - shows decimal places)
    % (modulus - shows the remainder of your calculation)

The last printed expression gets automatically assigned to a
"_" variable that can be used in a subsequent calculation: """

# tax = 12.5/100
# price = 100.50
# price * tax
# price + _

""" You can then use the round() function to round the last printed
to a specific number of decimal places, and print it: """

# 12.5 * 679.823
# round(_, 2) #The 2 rounds the number to 2 decimal places

""" p.s. "concatenation" is the act of joining strings :)
