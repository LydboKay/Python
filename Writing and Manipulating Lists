    list.remove(x) (Removes first item x from the list)
    list.pop(i) (Removes item at index position i and returns it)

    sort() method returns the list elements sorted first numerically, then alphabetically, e.g. 1,2,3,A,B,C)
    list.reverse() (Reverse all list items)

Also, len(L) function returns the length of the list L as the total number of eelemnets it contains.
MUCH LIKE THE INDEX() AND COUNT() METHODS, THE RETURNED VALUE IS NUMERIC, SO CAN'T BE DIRECTLY CONCATENATED
TO A TEXT STRING FOR OUTPUT BECAUSE IT IS NOT A STRING
-----> This can be solved by saying str(n) for concatenation, which returns the string version of the numeric value
-----> Similarly str(L) function for concatenation (keep in mind the returned versions are copies of the original)"""
